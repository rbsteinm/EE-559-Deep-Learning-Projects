# Deep learning miniprojects

Deep Learning course at EPFL (EE-559)

Group 2

Pierre-Antoine Desplaces and RaphaÃ«l Steinmann

## Miniproject 1

### What we did
- Normalized the data
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Basic MLP
- Basic Convonlutional Neural Network with a simple architecture (2 conv layers w max pooling, 2 fully connected layers, tanh activations, CrossEntropyLoss)
- Better CNN with one dimensional filter

### TODO
- Do a grid search on the parameters (step size, n_epochs)
- Try different architectures, loss functions, activation functions
- Try LSTM networks
- Check https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-thought-process-when-choosing-a-neural-network-architecture
- Check which architectures are more appropriate for time series
