## Deep Learning miniproject 1

Deep Learning course at EPFL (EE-559)

Group 2

Pierre-Antoine Desplaces and RaphaÃ«l Steinmann


### What we did
- Linear Regression
- Basic Neural Network with a simple architecture (3 layers, tanh, CrossEntropyLoss)

### TODO
- Do a grid search on the parameters (step size, n_epochs)
- Try different architectures, loss functions, activation functions
- Try LSTM networks
- Check https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-thought-process-when-choosing-a-neural-network-architecture
- Check which architectures are more appropriate for time series
